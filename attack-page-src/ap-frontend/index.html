          This page can predict the activity you are currently doing. 
          <br><br>
          Try it out, did we guess correctly?
          <br> </br>
          The activities this page is trained to  detect are the following:</br>
             Lying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Car, Bus, Tram, Train, Phone on table </br></br>

          The aim of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of your browser to collect mobile sensor data (such as from the accelerometer, gyroscope or magnetometer)
          to produce additional information about you, the user, who is currently visiting a website on the internet.
          <br> </br>
          This page focuses on deducing your activity using sensor data, and if some websites wanted to, they could track your real life activities 
          (or other information you unintentionally expose) across many sites.
        </br></br>
          The message of this is to consider disabling certain Javascript API (such as the Generic Sensor API from exposing sensor data) from running on your browsers, 
          or choose more privacy friendly browsers like Firefox or Brave.

        </br></br>

        How to run this demonstration: <br><br>

         Visit this website from your phone. This demonstration will work on browsers exposing sensor data, such as Chrome, Opera, Edge and other Chromium based browsers.
         <br>
         If you are on iOS, or are visiting from Firefox or Brave, you are safe from any mobile sensor data exposure without your consent and thus the demonstration will not work.  <br><br>
         
         By default in some browsers, the magnetometer is disabled, but that is ok, the experiment will still run (the magnetometer can be enabled with the flag #enable-generic-sensor-extra-classes in about:flags). 
        </br></br>
                <b>1.</b> Click Start to begin measurement.</br></br>
                <b>2.</b> Proceed to perform your activity and looking at your mobile screen.
              </br>
                </br>- Keep this page open, do not leave or turn off the screen.
                </br>- Measure for at least 5 seconds, then you may start to see first results. Continue with your activity</br></br>
                <b>3.</b> Click Stop to end activity recognition</br><br>
  
            <br>The data being processed in this demonstration may include information from accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers.
