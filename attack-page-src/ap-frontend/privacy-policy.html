<div class="policy">
    Internally, we collect personal data in line with GDPR including
    identification of your browser (content of the UserAgent HTTP header),
    your IP address, and timestamp of the measurement linked to the
    measurement data. These data are necessary for research purposes to
    evaluate the validity of the measurement, the context of the
    measurement, and perform the measurement. We will also use the
    measurement data to improve JShelter. We process these data with your
    consent.

    <br><br>

    These personal data are controlled by Brno University of Technology,
    Antonínská 548/1, 601 90 Brno, Czech Republic. Data protection officer
    is Mgr. Lucie Schimmelová, BUT, Antonínská 548/1, 601 90 Brno,
    Czech Republic, e-mail poverenec@vut.cz.
    
    <br><br>

    Direct contact e-mail address to the researchers: Radek Hranický (hranicky@fit.vut.cz).
    
    <br><br>

    Besides Brno University of Technology, we might share personal data
    with other researchers at other Universities or with Free Software Foundation, 51 Franklin St. 5th Floor Boston, MA 02110-1301
    USA. This parties will be our processors.
    
    <br><br>

    Personal data will be stored for the time that we will prepare a paper
    analyzing the data which should not exceed five years, during the time
    such paper is published and for five more years to archive the data,
    reproduce the measurements. We will create a public data set
    containing the measurement data but NOT containing IP address and NOT
    containing UserAgent HTTP header. However, we might accompany the
    measurement data with geolocation data. Note that an analysis of the
    measurement data may, theoretically, yield some more information about
    your behavior during the measurements (like the frequency of the
    steps). We consider publishing such data as necessary to support our
    measurement claims. We expect to publish at scientific venues that
    expect reproducibility. Please note that once such a data set is
    public, we will have no control on its copies.

    
    <br><br>


    To exercise your rights, please, send the researchers (preferred) or
    the data protection officer your request including the time of the
    measurement (as precisely as possible), if you were supplying data for
    the sensor data collection page (not the activity recognition demonstration), 
    include your IP address at which you conducted your measurement and your UserAgent HTTP header. Currently,
    your UserAgent is: <p id="user-agent"></p>
    And your IP address is: <p id="ip-address"></p>
    
    
    If you think that we process personal data in violation with GDPR, you
    can lodge complaint at Úřad pro ochranu osobních údajů, Pplk. Sochora
    27, 170 00 Praha 7, e-mail posta@uoou.cz, or, if you are located in
    other EEA country, at your local data protection authority.
